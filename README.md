# ClipPlayer
A tool for playing audio and midi files. This is intended to be used from the command line or Windows Explorer "Open With".
It displays a small UI so that playing can be stopped.

Midi playing is considered just "good enough" due to the inherent limitations of the windows multimedia timer.

# Usage
Easiest way is to associate it with audio files so it can be started with a simple click.
